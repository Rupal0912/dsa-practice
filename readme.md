# 🧠 DSA Practice Repository

Welcome to my **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) Practice** repository!  
This repo contains structured solutions and code snippets I've written while practicing DSA topics using **C++**.

## 📂 Structure

The repository is organized into folders by topic. Each folder contains problems, solutions, and occasionally multiple variations of problems related to that topic.

### 📁 Topics Covered:

- Arrays
- Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly)
- Stacks & Queues
- Strings
- Recursion & Backtracking
- Searching & Sorting
- Bit Manipulation
- Patterns
- OOPS (Object-Oriented Concepts)

## ⚙️ Language & Tools

- **Language:** C++
- **IDE:** VS Code
- **Version Control:** Git

---

## 💡 Purpose

- Build a solid foundation in DSA
- Improve problem-solving skills
- Maintain consistency in daily practice

## 📝 Notes

Some folders include multiple versions of solutions, or notes about variations in logic.  
Commit messages might be simple like `"did some changes"` — since this is a **learning repo**, the focus is on understanding, not perfection.
